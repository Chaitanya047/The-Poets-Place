            1<br>
            I celebrate myself, and sing myself,<br>
            And what I assume you shall assume,<br>
            For every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you.<br>
            <br>
            I loafe and invite my soul,<br>
            I lean and loafe at my ease observing a spear of summer grass.<br>
            <br>
            My tongue, every atom of my blood, form’d from this soil, this air,<br>
            Born here of parents born here from parents the same, and their parents the same,<br>
            I, now thirty-seven years old in perfect health begin,<br>
            Hoping to cease not till death.<br>
            <br>
            Creeds and schools in abeyance,<br>
            Retiring back a while sufficed at what they are, but never forgotten,<br>
            I harbor for good or bad, I permit to speak at every hazard,<br>
            Nature without check with original energy.<br>
            <br>
            2<br>
            Houses and rooms are full of perfumes, the shelves are crowded with perfumes,<br>
            I breathe the fragrance myself and know it and like it,<br>
            The distillation would intoxicate me also, but I shall not let it.<br>
            <br>
            The atmosphere is not a perfume, it has no taste of the distillation, it is odorless,<br>
            It is for my mouth forever, I am in love with it,<br>
            I will go to the bank by the wood and become undisguised and naked,<br>
            I am mad for it to be in contact with me.<br>
            <br>
            The smoke of my own breath,<br>
            Echoes, ripples, buzz’d whispers, love-root, silk-thread, crotch and vine,<br>
            My respiration and inspiration, the beating of my heart, the passing of blood and air through my lungs,<br>
            The sniff of green leaves and dry leaves, and of the shore and dark-color’d sea-rocks, and of hay in the
            barn,<br>
            The sound of the belch’d words of my voice loos’d to the eddies of the wind,<br>
            A few light kisses, a few embraces, a reaching around of arms,<br>
            The play of shine and shade on the trees as the supple boughs wag,<br>
            The delight alone or in the rush of the streets, or along the fields and hill-sides,<br>
            The feeling of health, the full-noon trill, the song of me rising from bed and meeting the sun.<br>
            <br>
            Have you reckon’d a thousand acres much? have you reckon’d the earth much?<br>
            Have you practis’d so long to learn to read?<br>
            Have you felt so proud to get at the meaning of poems?<br>
            <br>
            Stop this day and night with me and you shall possess the origin of all poems,<br>
            You shall possess the good of the earth and sun, (there are millions of suns left,)<br>
            You shall no longer take things at second or third hand, nor look through the eyes of the dead, nor feed on
            the spectres in books,<br>
            You shall not look through my eyes either, nor take things from me,<br>
            You shall listen to all sides and filter them from your self.<br>
            <br>
            3<br>
            I have heard what the talkers were talking, the talk of the beginning and the end,<br>
            But I do not talk of the beginning or the end.<br>
            <br>
            There was never any more inception than there is now,<br>
            Nor any more youth or age than there is now,<br>
            And will never be any more perfection than there is now,<br>
            Nor any more heaven or hell than there is now.<br>
            <br>
            Urge and urge and urge,<br>
            Always the procreant urge of the world.<br>
            <br>
            Out of the dimness opposite equals advance, always substance and increase, always sex,<br>
            Always a knit of identity, always distinction, always a breed of life.<br>
            <br>
            To elaborate is no avail, learn’d and unlearn’d feel that it is so.<br>
            <br>
            Sure as the most certain sure, plumb in the uprights, well entretied, braced in the beams,<br>
            Stout as a horse, affectionate, haughty, electrical,<br>
            I and this mystery here we stand.<br>
            <br>
            Clear and sweet is my soul, and clear and sweet is all that is not my soul.<br>
            <br>
            Lack one lacks both, and the unseen is proved by the seen,<br>
            Till that becomes unseen and receives proof in its turn.<br>
            <br>
            Showing the best and dividing it from the worst age vexes age,<br>
            Knowing the perfect fitness and equanimity of things, while they discuss I am silent, and go bathe and
            admire myself.<br>
            <br>
            Welcome is every organ and attribute of me, and of any man hearty and clean,<br>
            Not an inch nor a particle of an inch is vile, and none shall be less familiar than the rest.<br>
            <br>
            I am satisfied—I see, dance, laugh, sing;<br>
            As the hugging and loving bed-fellow sleeps at my side through the night, and withdraws at the peep of the
            day with stealthy tread,<br>
            Leaving me baskets cover’d with white towels swelling the house with their plenty,<br>
            Shall I postpone my acceptation and realization and scream at my eyes,<br>
            That they turn from gazing after and down the road,<br>
            And forthwith cipher and show me to a cent,<br>
            Exactly the value of one and exactly the value of two, and which is ahead?<br>
            <br>
            4<br>
            Trippers and askers surround me,<br>
            People I meet, the effect upon me of my early life or the ward and city I live in, or the nation,<br>
            The latest dates, discoveries, inventions, societies, authors old and new,<br>
            My dinner, dress, associates, looks, compliments, dues,<br>
            The real or fancied indifference of some man or woman I love,<br>
            The sickness of one of my folks or of myself, or ill-doing or loss or lack of money, or depressions or
            exaltations,<br>
            Battles, the horrors of fratricidal war, the fever of doubtful news, the fitful events;<br>
            These come to me days and nights and go from me again,<br>
            But they are not the Me myself.<br>
            <br>
            Apart from the pulling and hauling stands what I am,<br>
            Stands amused, complacent, compassionating, idle, unitary,<br>
            Looks down, is erect, or bends an arm on an impalpable certain rest,<br>
            Looking with side-curved head curious what will come next,<br>
            Both in and out of the game and watching and wondering at it.<br>
            <br>
            Backward I see in my own days where I sweated through fog with linguists and contenders,<br>
            I have no mockings or arguments, I witness and wait.<br>
            <br>
            5<br>
            I believe in you my soul, the other I am must not abase itself to you,<br>
            And you must not be abased to the other.<br>
            <br>
            Loafe with me on the grass, loose the stop from your throat,<br>
            Not words, not music or rhyme I want, not custom or lecture, not even the best,<br>
            Only the lull I like, the hum of your valvèd voice.<br>
            <br>
            I mind how once we lay such a transparent summer morning,<br>
            How you settled your head athwart my hips and gently turn’d over upon me,<br>
            And parted the shirt from my bosom-bone, and plunged your tongue to my bare-stript heart,<br>
            And reach’d till you felt my beard, and reach’d till you held my feet.<br>
            <br>
            Swiftly arose and spread around me the peace and knowledge that pass all the argument of the earth,<br>
            And I know that the hand of God is the promise of my own,<br>
            And I know that the spirit of God is the brother of my own,<br>
            And that all the men ever born are also my brothers, and the women my sisters and lovers,<br>
            And that a kelson of the creation is love,<br>
            And limitless are leaves stiff or drooping in the fields,<br>
            And brown ants in the little wells beneath them,<br>
            And mossy scabs of the worm fence, heap’d stones, elder, mullein and poke-weed.<br>
            <br>
            6<br>
            A child said What is the grass? fetching it to me with full hands;<br>
            How could I answer the child? I do not know what it is any more than he.<br>
            <br>
            I guess it must be the flag of my disposition, out of hopeful green stuff woven.<br>
            <br>
            Or I guess it is the handkerchief of the Lord,<br>
            A scented gift and remembrancer designedly dropt,<br>
            Bearing the owner’s name someway in the corners, that we may see and remark, and say Whose?<br>
            <br>
            Or I guess the grass is itself a child, the produced babe of the vegetation.<br>
            <br>
            Or I guess it is a uniform hieroglyphic,<br>
            And it means, Sprouting alike in broad zones and narrow zones,<br>
            Growing among black folks as among white,<br>
            Kanuck, Tuckahoe, Congressman, Cuff, I give them the same, I receive them the same.<br>
            <br>
            And now it seems to me the beautiful uncut hair of graves.<br>
            <br>
            Tenderly will I use you curling grass,<br>
            It may be you transpire from the breasts of young men,<br>
            It may be if I had known them I would have loved them,<br>
            It may be you are from old people, or from offspring taken soon out of their mothers’ laps,<br>
            And here you are the mothers’ laps.<br>
            <br>
            This grass is very dark to be from the white heads of old mothers,<br>
            Darker than the colorless beards of old men,<br>
            Dark to come from under the faint red roofs of mouths.<br>
            <br>
            O I perceive after all so many uttering tongues,<br>
            And I perceive they do not come from the roofs of mouths for nothing.<br>
            <br>
            I wish I could translate the hints about the dead young men and women,<br>
            And the hints about old men and mothers, and the offspring taken soon out of their laps.<br>
            <br>
            What do you think has become of the young and old men?<br>
            And what do you think has become of the women and children?<br>
            <br>
            They are alive and well somewhere,<br>
            The smallest sprout shows there is really no death,<br>
            And if ever there was it led forward life, and does not wait at the end to arrest it,<br>
            And ceas’d the moment life appear’d.<br>
            <br>
            All goes onward and outward, nothing collapses,<br>
            And to die is different from what any one supposed, and luckier.<br>
            <br>
            7<br>
            Has any one supposed it lucky to be born?<br>
            I hasten to inform him or her it is just as lucky to die, and I know it.<br>
            <br>
            I pass death with the dying and birth with the new-wash’d babe, and am not contain’d between my hat and
            boots,<br>
            And peruse manifold objects, no two alike and every one good,<br>
            The earth good and the stars good, and their adjuncts all good.<br>
            <br>
            I am not an earth nor an adjunct of an earth,<br>
            I am the mate and companion of people, all just as immortal and fathomless as myself,<br>
            (They do not know how immortal, but I know.)<br>
            <br>
            Every kind for itself and its own, for me mine male and female,<br>
            For me those that have been boys and that love women,<br>
            For me the man that is proud and feels how it stings to be slighted,<br>
            For me the sweet-heart and the old maid, for me mothers and the mothers of mothers,<br>
            For me lips that have smiled, eyes that have shed tears,<br>
            For me children and the begetters of children.<br>
            <br>
            Undrape! you are not guilty to me, nor stale nor discarded,<br>
            I see through the broadcloth and gingham whether or no,<br>
            And am around, tenacious, acquisitive, tireless, and cannot be shaken away.<br>
            <br>
            8<br>
            The little one sleeps in its cradle,<br>
            I lift the gauze and look a long time, and silently brush away flies with my hand.<br>
            <br>
            The youngster and the red-faced girl turn aside up the bushy hill,<br>
            I peeringly view them from the top.<br>
            <br>
            The suicide sprawls on the bloody floor of the bedroom,<br>
            I witness the corpse with its dabbled hair, I note where the pistol has fallen.<br>
            <br>
            The blab of the pave, tires of carts, sluff of boot-soles, talk of the promenaders,<br>
            The heavy omnibus, the driver with his interrogating thumb, the clank of the shod horses on the granite
            floor,<br>
            The snow-sleighs, clinking, shouted jokes, pelts of snow-balls,<br>
            The hurrahs for popular favorites, the fury of rous’d mobs,<br>
            The flap of the curtain’d litter, a sick man inside borne to the hospital,<br>
            The meeting of enemies, the sudden oath, the blows and fall,<br>
            The excited crowd, the policeman with his star quickly working his passage to the centre of the crowd,<br>
            The impassive stones that receive and return so many echoes,<br>
            What groans of over-fed or half-starv’d who fall sunstruck or in fits,<br>
            What exclamations of women taken suddenly who hurry home and give birth to babes,<br>
            What living and buried speech is always vibrating here, what howls restrain’d by decorum,<br>
            Arrests of criminals, slights, adulterous offers made, acceptances, rejections with convex lips,<br>
            I mind them or the show or resonance of them—I come and I depart.<br>
            <br>
            9<br>
            The big doors of the country barn stand open and ready,<br>
            The dried grass of the harvest-time loads the slow-drawn wagon,<br>
            The clear light plays on the brown gray and green intertinged,<br>
            The armfuls are pack’d to the sagging mow.<br>
            <br>
            I am there, I help, I came stretch’d atop of the load,<br>
            I felt its soft jolts, one leg reclined on the other,<br>
            I jump from the cross-beams and seize the clover and timothy,<br>
            And roll head over heels and tangle my hair full of wisps.<br>
            <br>
            10<br>
            Alone far in the wilds and mountains I hunt,<br>
            Wandering amazed at my own lightness and glee,<br>
            In the late afternoon choosing a safe spot to pass the night,<br>
            Kindling a fire and broiling the fresh-kill’d game,<br>
            Falling asleep on the gather’d leaves with my dog and gun by my side.<br>
            <br>
            The Yankee clipper is under her sky-sails, she cuts the sparkle and scud,<br>
            <br>
            My eyes settle the land, I bend at her prow or shout joyously from the deck.<br>
            <br>
            The boatmen and clam-diggers arose early and stopt for me,<br>
            I tuck’d my trowser-ends in my boots and went and had a good time;<br>
            You should have been with us that day round the chowder-kettle.<br>
            <br>
            I saw the marriage of the trapper in the open air in the far west, the bride was a red girl,<br>
            Her father and his friends sat near cross-legged and dumbly smoking, they had moccasins to their feet and
            large thick blankets hanging from their shoulders,<br>
            On a bank lounged the trapper, he was drest mostly in skins, his luxuriant beard and curls protected his
            neck, he held his bride by the hand,<br>
            She had long eyelashes, her head was bare, her coarse straight locks descended upon her voluptuous limbs and
            reach’d to her feet.<br>
            <br>
            The runaway slave came to my house and stopt outside,<br>
            I heard his motions crackling the twigs of the woodpile,<br>
            Through the swung half-door of the kitchen I saw him limpsy and weak,<br>
            And went where he sat on a log and led him in and assured him,<br>
            And brought water and fill’d a tub for his sweated body and bruis’d feet,<br>
            And gave him a room that enter’d from my own, and gave him some coarse clean clothes,<br>
            And remember perfectly well his revolving eyes and his awkwardness,<br>
            And remember putting plasters on the galls of his neck and ankles;<br>
            He staid with me a week before he was recuperated and pass’d north,<br>
            I had him sit next me at table, my fire-lock lean’d in the corner.<br>
            <br>
            11<br>
            Twenty-eight young men bathe by the shore,<br>
            Twenty-eight young men and all so friendly;<br>
            Twenty-eight years of womanly life and all so lonesome.<br>
            <br>
            She owns the fine house by the rise of the bank,<br>
            She hides handsome and richly drest aft the blinds of the window.<br>
            <br>
            Which of the young men does she like the best?<br>
            Ah the homeliest of them is beautiful to her.<br>
            <br>
            Where are you off to, lady? for I see you,<br>
            You splash in the water there, yet stay stock still in your room.<br>
            <br>
            Dancing and laughing along the beach came the twenty-ninth bather,<br>
            The rest did not see her, but she saw them and loved them.<br>
            <br>
            The beards of the young men glisten’d with wet, it ran from their long hair,<br>
            Little streams pass’d all over their bodies.<br>
            <br>
            An unseen hand also pass’d over their bodies,<br>
            It descended tremblingly from their temples and ribs.<br>
            <br>
            The young men float on their backs, their white bellies bulge to the sun, they do not ask who seizes fast to
            them,<br>
            They do not know who puffs and declines with pendant and bending arch,<br>
            They do not think whom they souse with spray.<br>
            <br>
            12<br>
            The butcher-boy puts off his killing-clothes, or sharpens his knife at the stall in the market,<br>
            I loiter enjoying his repartee and his shuffle and break-down.<br>
            <br>
            Blacksmiths with grimed and hairy chests environ the anvil,<br>
            Each has his main-sledge, they are all out, there is a great heat in the fire.<br>
            <br>
            From the cinder-strew’d threshold I follow their movements,<br>
            The lithe sheer of their waists plays even with their massive arms,<br>
            Overhand the hammers swing, overhand so slow, overhand so sure,<br>
            They do not hasten, each man hits in his place.<br>
            <br>
            13<br>
            The negro holds firmly the reins of his four horses, the block swags underneath on its tied-over chain,<br>
            The negro that drives the long dray of the stone-yard, steady and tall he stands pois’d on one leg on the
            string-piece,<br>
            His blue shirt exposes his ample neck and breast and loosens over his hip-band,<br>
            His glance is calm and commanding, he tosses the slouch of his hat away from his forehead,<br>
            The sun falls on his crispy hair and mustache, falls on the black of his polish’d and perfect limbs.<br>
            <br>
            I behold the picturesque giant and love him, and I do not stop there,<br>
            I go with the team also.<br>
            <br>
            In me the caresser of life wherever moving, backward as well as forward sluing,<br>
            To niches aside and junior bending, not a person or object missing,<br>
            Absorbing all to myself and for this song.<br>
            <br>
            Oxen that rattle the yoke and chain or halt in the leafy shade, what is that you express in your eyes?<br>
            It seems to me more than all the print I have read in my life.<br>
            <br>
            My tread scares the wood-drake and wood-duck on my distant and day-long ramble,<br>
            They rise together, they slowly circle around.<br>
            <br>
            I believe in those wing’d purposes,<br>
            And acknowledge red, yellow, white, playing within me,<br>
            And consider green and violet and the tufted crown intentional,<br>
            And do not call the tortoise unworthy because she is not something else,<br>
            And the jay in the woods never studied the gamut, yet trills pretty well to me,<br>
            And the look of the bay mare shames silliness out of me.<br>
            <br>
            14<br>
            The wild gander leads his flock through the cool night,<br>
            Ya-honk he says, and sounds it down to me like an invitation,<br>
            The pert may suppose it meaningless, but I listening close,<br>
            Find its purpose and place up there toward the wintry sky.<br>
            <br>
            The sharp-hoof’d moose of the north, the cat on the house-sill, the chickadee, the prairie-dog,<br>
            The litter of the grunting sow as they tug at her teats,<br>
            The brood of the turkey-hen and she with her half-spread wings,<br>
            I see in them and myself the same old law.<br>
            <br>
            The press of my foot to the earth springs a hundred affections,<br>
            They scorn the best I can do to relate them.<br>
            <br>
            I am enamour’d of growing out-doors,<br>
            Of men that live among cattle or taste of the ocean or woods,<br>
            Of the builders and steerers of ships and the wielders of axes and mauls, and the drivers of horses,<br>
            I can eat and sleep with them week in and week out.<br>
            <br>
            What is commonest, cheapest, nearest, easiest, is Me,<br>
            Me going in for my chances, spending for vast returns,<br>
            Adorning myself to bestow myself on the first that will take me,<br>
            Not asking the sky to come down to my good will,<br>
            Scattering it freely forever.<br>
            <br>
            15<br>
            The pure contralto sings in the organ loft,<br>
            The carpenter dresses his plank, the tongue of his foreplane whistles its wild ascending lisp,<br>
            The married and unmarried children ride home to their Thanksgiving dinner,<br>
            The pilot seizes the king-pin, he heaves down with a strong arm,<br>
            The mate stands braced in the whale-boat, lance and harpoon are ready,<br>
            <br>
            The duck-shooter walks by silent and cautious stretches,<br>
            The deacons are ordain’d with cross’d hands at the altar,<br>
            The spinning-girl retreats and advances to the hum of the big wheel,<br>
            The farmer stops by the bars as he walks on a First-day loafe and looks at the oats and rye,<br>
            The lunatic is carried at last to the asylum a confirm’d case,<br>
            (He will never sleep any more as he did in the cot in his mother’s bed-room;)<br>
            The jour printer with gray head and gaunt jaws works at his case,<br>
            He turns his quid of tobacco while his eyes blurr with the manuscript;<br>
            The malform’d limbs are tied to the surgeon’s table,<br>
            What is removed drops horribly in a pail;<br>
            The quadroon girl is sold at the auction-stand, the drunkard nods by the bar-room stove,<br>
            The machinist rolls up his sleeves, the policeman travels his beat, the gate-keeper marks who pass,<br>
            The young fellow drives the express-wagon, (I love him, though I do not know him;)<br>
            The half-breed straps on his light boots to compete in the race,<br>
            The western turkey-shooting draws old and young, some lean on their rifles, some sit on logs,<br>
            Out from the crowd steps the marksman, takes his position, levels his piece;<br>
            The groups of newly-come immigrants cover the wharf or levee,<br>
            As the woolly-pates hoe in the sugar-field, the overseer views them from his saddle,<br>
            The bugle calls in the ball-room, the gentlemen run for their partners, the dancers bow to each other,<br>
            The youth lies awake in the cedar-roof’d garret and harks to the musical rain,<br>
            The Wolverine sets traps on the creek that helps fill the Huron,<br>
            The squaw wrapt in her yellow-hemm’d cloth is offering moccasins and bead-bags for sale,<br>
            The connoisseur peers along the exhibition-gallery with half-shut eyes bent sideways,<br>
            As the deck-hands make fast the steamboat the plank is thrown for the shore-going passengers,<br>
            The young sister holds out the skein while the elder sister winds it off in a ball, and stops now and then
            for the knots,<br>
            The one-year wife is recovering and happy having a week ago borne her first child,<br>
            The clean-hair’d Yankee girl works with her sewing-machine or in the factory or mill,<br>
            The paving-man leans on his two-handed rammer, the reporter’s lead flies swiftly over the note-book, the
            sign-painter is lettering with blue and gold,<br>
            The canal boy trots on the tow-path, the book-keeper counts at his desk, the shoemaker waxes his thread,<br>
            The conductor beats time for the band and all the performers follow him,<br>
            The child is baptized, the convert is making his first professions,<br>
            The regatta is spread on the bay, the race is begun, (how the white sails sparkle!)<br>
            The drover watching his drove sings out to them that would stray,<br>
            The pedler sweats with his pack on his back, (the purchaser higgling about the odd cent;)<br>
            The bride unrumples her white dress, the minute-hand of the clock moves slowly,<br>
            The opium-eater reclines with rigid head and just-open’d lips,<br>
            The prostitute draggles her shawl, her bonnet bobs on her tipsy and pimpled neck,<br>
            The crowd laugh at her blackguard oaths, the men jeer and wink to each other,<br>
            (Miserable! I do not laugh at your oaths nor jeer you;)<br>
            The President holding a cabinet council is surrounded by the great Secretaries,<br>
            On the piazza walk three matrons stately and friendly with twined arms,<br>
            The crew of the fish-smack pack repeated layers of halibut in the hold,<br>
            The Missourian crosses the plains toting his wares and his cattle,<br>
            As the fare-collector goes through the train he gives notice by the jingling of loose change,<br>
            The floor-men are laying the floor, the tinners are tinning the roof, the masons are calling for mortar,<br>
            In single file each shouldering his hod pass onward the laborers;<br>
            Seasons pursuing each other the indescribable crowd is gather’d, it is the fourth of Seventh-month, (what
            salutes of cannon and small arms!)<br>
            Seasons pursuing each other the plougher ploughs, the mower mows, and the winter-grain falls in the
            ground;<br>
            Off on the lakes the pike-fisher watches and waits by the hole in the frozen surface,<br>
            The stumps stand thick round the clearing, the squatter strikes deep with his axe,<br>
            Flatboatmen make fast towards dusk near the cotton-wood or pecan-trees,<br>
            Coon-seekers go through the regions of the Red river or through those drain’d by the Tennessee, or through
            those of the Arkansas,<br>
            Torches shine in the dark that hangs on the Chattahooche or Altamahaw,<br>
            <br>
            Patriarchs sit at supper with sons and grandsons and great-grandsons around them,<br>
            In walls of adobie, in canvas tents, rest hunters and trappers after their day’s sport,<br>
            The city sleeps and the country sleeps,<br>
            The living sleep for their time, the dead sleep for their time,<br>
            The old husband sleeps by his wife and the young husband sleeps by his wife;<br>
            And these tend inward to me, and I tend outward to them,<br>
            And such as it is to be of these more or less I am,<br>
            And of these one and all I weave the song of myself.<br>
            <br>
            16<br>
            I am of old and young, of the foolish as much as the wise,<br>
            Regardless of others, ever regardful of others,<br>
            Maternal as well as paternal, a child as well as a man,<br>
            Stuff’d with the stuff that is coarse and stuff’d with the stuff that is fine,<br>
            One of the Nation of many nations, the smallest the same and the largest the same,<br>
            A Southerner soon as a Northerner, a planter nonchalant and hospitable down by the Oconee I live,<br>
            A Yankee bound my own way ready for trade, my joints the limberest joints on earth and the sternest joints
            on earth,<br>
            A Kentuckian walking the vale of the Elkhorn in my deer-skin leggings, a Louisianian or Georgian,<br>
            A boatman over lakes or bays or along coasts, a Hoosier, Badger, Buckeye;<br>
            At home on Kanadian snow-shoes or up in the bush, or with fishermen off Newfoundland,<br>
            At home in the fleet of ice-boats, sailing with the rest and tacking,<br>
            At home on the hills of Vermont or in the woods of Maine, or the Texan ranch,<br>
            Comrade of Californians, comrade of free North-Westerners, (loving their big proportions,)<br>
            Comrade of raftsmen and coalmen, comrade of all who shake hands and welcome to drink and meat,<br>
            A learner with the simplest, a teacher of the thoughtfullest,<br>
            A novice beginning yet experient of myriads of seasons,<br>
            Of every hue and caste am I, of every rank and religion,<br>
            A farmer, mechanic, artist, gentleman, sailor, quaker,<br>
            Prisoner, fancy-man, rowdy, lawyer, physician, priest.<br>
            <br>
            I resist any thing better than my own diversity,<br>
            Breathe the air but leave plenty after me,<br>
            And am not stuck up, and am in my place.<br>
            <br>
            (The moth and the fish-eggs are in their place,<br>
            The bright suns I see and the dark suns I cannot see are in their place,<br>
            The palpable is in its place and the impalpable is in its place.)<br>
            <br>
            17<br>
            These are really the thoughts of all men in all ages and lands, they are not original with me,<br>
            If they are not yours as much as mine they are nothing, or next to nothing,<br>
            If they are not the riddle and the untying of the riddle they are nothing,<br>
            If they are not just as close as they are distant they are nothing.<br>
            <br>
            This is the grass that grows wherever the land is and the water is,<br>
            This the common air that bathes the globe.<br>
            <br>
            18<br>
            With music strong I come, with my cornets and my drums,<br>
            I play not marches for accepted victors only, I play marches for conquer’d and slain persons.<br>
            <br>
            Have you heard that it was good to gain the day?<br>
            I also say it is good to fall, battles are lost in the same spirit in which they are won.<br>
            <br>
            I beat and pound for the dead,<br>
            I blow through my embouchures my loudest and gayest for them.<br>
            <br>
            Vivas to those who have fail’d!<br>
            And to those whose war-vessels sank in the sea!<br>
            And to those themselves who sank in the sea!<br>
            And to all generals that lost engagements, and all overcome heroes!<br>
            And the numberless unknown heroes equal to the greatest heroes known!<br>
            <br>
            19<br>
            This is the meal equally set, this the meat for natural hunger,<br>
            It is for the wicked just the same as the righteous, I make appointments with all,<br>
            I will not have a single person slighted or left away,<br>
            The kept-woman, sponger, thief, are hereby invited,<br>
            The heavy-lipp’d slave is invited, the venerealee is invited;<br>
            There shall be no difference between them and the rest.<br>
            <br>
            This is the press of a bashful hand, this the float and odor of hair,<br>
            This the touch of my lips to yours, this the murmur of yearning,<br>
            This the far-off depth and height reflecting my own face,<br>
            This the thoughtful merge of myself, and the outlet again.<br>
            <br>
            Do you guess I have some intricate purpose?<br>
            Well I have, for the Fourth-month showers have, and the mica on the side of a rock has.<br>
            <br>
            Do you take it I would astonish?<br>
            Does the daylight astonish? does the early redstart twittering through the woods?<br>
            Do I astonish more than they?<br>
            <br>
            This hour I tell things in confidence,<br>
            I might not tell everybody, but I will tell you.<br>
            <br>
            20<br>
            Who goes there? hankering, gross, mystical, nude;<br>
            How is it I extract strength from the beef I eat?<br>
            <br>
            What is a man anyhow? what am I? what are you?<br>
            <br>
            All I mark as my own you shall offset it with your own,<br>
            Else it were time lost listening to me.<br>
            <br>
            I do not snivel that snivel the world over,<br>
            That months are vacuums and the ground but wallow and filth.<br>
            <br>
            Whimpering and truckling fold with powders for invalids, conformity goes to the fourth-remov’d,<br>
            I wear my hat as I please indoors or out.<br>
            <br>
            Why should I pray? why should I venerate and be ceremonious?<br>
            <br>
            Having pried through the strata, analyzed to a hair, counsel’d with doctors and calculated close,<br>
            I find no sweeter fat than sticks to my own bones.<br>
            <br>
            In all people I see myself, none more and not one a barley-corn less,<br>
            And the good or bad I say of myself I say of them.<br>
            <br>
            I know I am solid and sound,<br>
            To me the converging objects of the universe perpetually flow,<br>
            All are written to me, and I must get what the writing means.<br>
            <br>
            I know I am deathless,<br>
            I know this orbit of mine cannot be swept by a carpenter’s compass,<br>
            I know I shall not pass like a child’s carlacue cut with a burnt stick at night.<br>
            <br>
            I know I am august,<br>
            I do not trouble my spirit to vindicate itself or be understood,<br>
            I see that the elementary laws never apologize,<br>
            (I reckon I behave no prouder than the level I plant my house by, after all.)<br>
            <br>
            I exist as I am, that is enough,<br>
            If no other in the world be aware I sit content,<br>
            And if each and all be aware I sit content.<br>
            <br>
            One world is aware and by far the largest to me, and that is myself,<br>
            And whether I come to my own to-day or in ten thousand or ten million years,<br>
            I can cheerfully take it now, or with equal cheerfulness I can wait.<br>
            <br>
            My foothold is tenon’d and mortis’d in granite,<br>
            I laugh at what you call dissolution,<br>
            And I know the amplitude of time.<br>
            <br>
            21<br>
            I am the poet of the Body and I am the poet of the Soul,<br>
            The pleasures of heaven are with me and the pains of hell are with me,<br>
            The first I graft and increase upon myself, the latter I translate into a new tongue.<br>
            <br>
            I am the poet of the woman the same as the man,<br>
            And I say it is as great to be a woman as to be a man,<br>
            And I say there is nothing greater than the mother of men.<br>
            <br>
            I chant the chant of dilation or pride,<br>
            We have had ducking and deprecating about enough,<br>
            I show that size is only development.<br>
            <br>
            Have you outstript the rest? are you the President?<br>
            It is a trifle, they will more than arrive there every one, and still pass on.<br>
            <br>
            I am he that walks with the tender and growing night,<br>
            I call to the earth and sea half-held by the night.<br>
            <br>
            Press close bare-bosom’d night—press close magnetic nourishing night!<br>
            Night of south winds—night of the large few stars!<br>
            Still nodding night—mad naked summer night.<br>
            <br>
            Smile O voluptuous cool-breath’d earth!<br>
            Earth of the slumbering and liquid trees!<br>
            Earth of departed sunset—earth of the mountains misty-topt!<br>
            Earth of the vitreous pour of the full moon just tinged with blue!<br>
            Earth of shine and dark mottling the tide of the river!<br>
            Earth of the limpid gray of clouds brighter and clearer for my sake!<br>
            Far-swooping elbow’d earth—rich apple-blossom’d earth!<br>
            Smile, for your lover comes.<br>
            <br>
            Prodigal, you have given me love—therefore I to you give love!<br>
            O unspeakable passionate love.<br>
            <br>
            22<br>
            You sea! I resign myself to you also—I guess what you mean,<br>
            I behold from the beach your crooked inviting fingers,<br>
            I believe you refuse to go back without feeling of me,<br>
            We must have a turn together, I undress, hurry me out of sight of the land,<br>
            Cushion me soft, rock me in billowy drowse,<br>
            Dash me with amorous wet, I can repay you.<br>
            <br>
            Sea of stretch’d ground-swells,<br>
            Sea breathing broad and convulsive breaths,<br>
            Sea of the brine of life and of unshovell’d yet always-ready graves,<br>
            Howler and scooper of storms, capricious and dainty sea,<br>
            I am integral with you, I too am of one phase and of all phases.<br>
            <br>
            Partaker of influx and efflux I, extoller of hate and conciliation,<br>
            Extoller of amies and those that sleep in each others’ arms.<br>
            <br>
            I am he attesting sympathy,<br>
            (Shall I make my list of things in the house and skip the house that supports them?)<br>
            <br>
            I am not the poet of goodness only, I do not decline to be the poet of wickedness also.<br>
            <br>
            What blurt is this about virtue and about vice?<br>
            Evil propels me and reform of evil propels me, I stand indifferent,<br>
            My gait is no fault-finder’s or rejecter’s gait,<br>
            I moisten the roots of all that has grown.<br>
            <br>
            Did you fear some scrofula out of the unflagging pregnancy?<br>
            Did you guess the celestial laws are yet to be work’d over and rectified?<br>
            <br>
            I find one side a balance and the antipodal side a balance,<br>
            Soft doctrine as steady help as stable doctrine,<br>
            Thoughts and deeds of the present our rouse and early start.<br>
            <br>
            This minute that comes to me over the past decillions,<br>
            There is no better than it and now.<br>
            <br>
            What behaved well in the past or behaves well to-day is not such a wonder,<br>
            The wonder is always and always how there can be a mean man or an infidel.<br>
            <br>
            23<br>
            Endless unfolding of words of ages!<br>
            And mine a word of the modern, the word En-Masse.<br>
            <br>
            A word of the faith that never balks,<br>
            Here or henceforward it is all the same to me, I accept Time absolutely.<br>
            <br>
            It alone is without flaw, it alone rounds and completes all,<br>
            That mystic baffling wonder alone completes all.<br>
            <br>
            I accept Reality and dare not question it,<br>
            Materialism first and last imbuing.<br>
            <br>
            Hurrah for positive science! long live exact demonstration!<br>
            Fetch stonecrop mixt with cedar and branches of lilac,<br>
            This is the lexicographer, this the chemist, this made a grammar of the old cartouches,<br>
            These mariners put the ship through dangerous unknown seas.<br>
            This is the geologist, this works with the scalpel, and this is a mathematician.<br>
            <br>
            Gentlemen, to you the first honors always!<br>
            Your facts are useful, and yet they are not my dwelling,<br>
            I but enter by them to an area of my dwelling.<br>
            <br>
            Less the reminders of properties told my words,<br>
            And more the reminders they of life untold, and of freedom and extrication,<br>
            And make short account of neuters and geldings, and favor men and women fully equipt,<br>
            And beat the gong of revolt, and stop with fugitives and them that plot and conspire.<br>
            <br>
            24<br>
            Walt Whitman, a kosmos, of Manhattan the son,<br>
            Turbulent, fleshy, sensual, eating, drinking and breeding,<br>
            No sentimentalist, no stander above men and women or apart from them,<br>
            No more modest than immodest.<br>
            <br>
            Unscrew the locks from the doors!<br>
            Unscrew the doors themselves from their jambs!<br>
            <br>
            Whoever degrades another degrades me,<br>
            And whatever is done or said returns at last to me.<br>
            <br>
            Through me the afflatus surging and surging, through me the current and index.<br>
            <br>
            I speak the pass-word primeval, I give the sign of democracy,<br>
            By God! I will accept nothing which all cannot have their counterpart of on the same terms.<br>
            <br>
            Through me many long dumb voices,<br>
            Voices of the interminable generations of prisoners and slaves,<br>
            Voices of the diseas’d and despairing and of thieves and dwarfs,<br>
            Voices of cycles of preparation and accretion,<br>
            And of the threads that connect the stars, and of wombs and of the father-stuff,<br>
            And of the rights of them the others are down upon,<br>
            Of the deform’d, trivial, flat, foolish, despised,<br>
            Fog in the air, beetles rolling balls of dung.<br>
            <br>
            Through me forbidden voices,<br>
            Voices of sexes and lusts, voices veil’d and I remove the veil,<br>
            Voices indecent by me clarified and transfigur’d.<br>
            <br>
            I do not press my fingers across my mouth,<br>
            I keep as delicate around the bowels as around the head and heart,<br>
            Copulation is no more rank to me than death is.<br>
            <br>
            I believe in the flesh and the appetites,<br>
            Seeing, hearing, feeling, are miracles, and each part and tag of me is a miracle.<br>
            <br>
            Divine am I inside and out, and I make holy whatever I touch or am touch’d from,<br>
            The scent of these arm-pits aroma finer than prayer,<br>
            This head more than churches, bibles, and all the creeds.<br>
            <br>
            If I worship one thing more than another it shall be the spread of my own body, or any part of it,<br>
            Translucent mould of me it shall be you!<br>
            Shaded ledges and rests it shall be you!<br>
            Firm masculine colter it shall be you!<br>
            Whatever goes to the tilth of me it shall be you!<br>
            You my rich blood! your milky stream pale strippings of my life!<br>
            Breast that presses against other breasts it shall be you!<br>
            My brain it shall be your occult convolutions!<br>
            Root of wash’d sweet-flag! timorous pond-snipe! nest of guarded duplicate eggs! it shall be you!<br>
            Mix’d tussled hay of head, beard, brawn, it shall be you!<br>
            Trickling sap of maple, fibre of manly wheat, it shall be you!<br>
            Sun so generous it shall be you!<br>
            Vapors lighting and shading my face it shall be you!<br>
            You sweaty brooks and dews it shall be you!<br>
            Winds whose soft-tickling genitals rub against me it shall be you!<br>
            Broad muscular fields, branches of live oak, loving lounger in my winding paths, it shall be you!<br>
            Hands I have taken, face I have kiss’d, mortal I have ever touch’d, it shall be you.<br>
            <br>
            I dote on myself, there is that lot of me and all so luscious,<br>
            Each moment and whatever happens thrills me with joy,<br>
            I cannot tell how my ankles bend, nor whence the cause of my faintest wish,<br>
            Nor the cause of the friendship I emit, nor the cause of the friendship I take again.<br>
            <br>
            That I walk up my stoop, I pause to consider if it really be,<br>
            A morning-glory at my window satisfies me more than the metaphysics of books.<br>
            <br>
            To behold the day-break!<br>
            The little light fades the immense and diaphanous shadows,<br>
            The air tastes good to my palate.<br>
            <br>
            Hefts of the moving world at innocent gambols silently rising freshly exuding,<br>
            Scooting obliquely high and low.<br>
            <br>
            Something I cannot see puts upward libidinous prongs,<br>
            Seas of bright juice suffuse heaven.<br>
            <br>
            The earth by the sky staid with, the daily close of their junction,<br>
            The heav’d challenge from the east that moment over my head,<br>
            The mocking taunt, See then whether you shall be master!<br>
            <br>
            25<br>
            Dazzling and tremendous how quick the sun-rise would kill me,<br>
            If I could not now and always send sun-rise out of me.<br>
            <br>
            We also ascend dazzling and tremendous as the sun,<br>
            We found our own O my soul in the calm and cool of the daybreak.<br>
            <br>
            My voice goes after what my eyes cannot reach,<br>
            With the twirl of my tongue I encompass worlds and volumes of worlds.<br>
            <br>
            Speech is the twin of my vision, it is unequal to measure itself,<br>
            It provokes me forever, it says sarcastically,<br>
            Walt you contain enough, why don’t you let it out then?<br>
            <br>
            Come now I will not be tantalized, you conceive too much of articulation,<br>
            Do you not know O speech how the buds beneath you are folded?<br>
            Waiting in gloom, protected by frost,<br>
            The dirt receding before my prophetical screams,<br>
            I underlying causes to balance them at last,<br>
            My knowledge my live parts, it keeping tally with the meaning of all things,<br>
            Happiness, (which whoever hears me let him or her set out in search of this day.)<br>
            <br>
            My final merit I refuse you, I refuse putting from me what I really am,<br>
            Encompass worlds, but never try to encompass me,<br>
            I crowd your sleekest and best by simply looking toward you.<br>
            <br>
            Writing and talk do not prove me,<br>
            I carry the plenum of proof and every thing else in my face,<br>
            With the hush of my lips I wholly confound the skeptic.<br>
            <br>
            26<br>
            Now I will do nothing but listen,<br>
            To accrue what I hear into this song, to let sounds contribute toward it.<br>
            <br>
            I hear bravuras of birds, bustle of growing wheat, gossip of flames, clack of sticks cooking my meals,<br>
            I hear the sound I love, the sound of the human voice,<br>
            I hear all sounds running together, combined, fused or following,<br>
            Sounds of the city and sounds out of the city, sounds of the day and night,<br>
            Talkative young ones to those that like them, the loud laugh of work-people at their meals,<br>
            The angry base of disjointed friendship, the faint tones of the sick,<br>
            The judge with hands tight to the desk, his pallid lips pronouncing a death-sentence,<br>
            The heave’e’yo of stevedores unlading ships by the wharves, the refrain of the anchor-lifters,<br>
            The ring of alarm-bells, the cry of fire, the whirr of swift-streaking engines and hose-carts with
            premonitory tinkles and color’d lights,<br>
            The steam whistle, the solid roll of the train of approaching cars,<br>
            The slow march play’d at the head of the association marching two and two,<br>
            (They go to guard some corpse, the flag-tops are draped with black muslin.)<br>
            <br>
            I hear the violoncello, (’tis the young man’s heart’s complaint,)<br>
            I hear the key’d cornet, it glides quickly in through my ears,<br>
            It shakes mad-sweet pangs through my belly and breast.<br>
            <br>
            I hear the chorus, it is a grand opera,<br>
            Ah this indeed is music—this suits me.<br>
            <br>
            A tenor large and fresh as the creation fills me,<br>
            The orbic flex of his mouth is pouring and filling me full.<br>
            <br>
            I hear the train’d soprano (what work with hers is this?)<br>
            The orchestra whirls me wider than Uranus flies,<br>
            It wrenches such ardors from me I did not know I possess’d them,<br>
            It sails me, I dab with bare feet, they are lick’d by the indolent waves,<br>
            I am cut by bitter and angry hail, I lose my breath,<br>
            Steep’d amid honey’d morphine, my windpipe throttled in fakes of death,<br>
            <br>
            At length let up again to feel the puzzle of puzzles,<br>
            And that we call Being.<br>
            <br>
            27<br>
            To be in any form, what is that?<br>
            (Round and round we go, all of us, and ever come back thither,)<br>
            If nothing lay more develop’d the quahaug in its callous shell were enough.<br>
            <br>
            Mine is no callous shell,<br>
            I have instant conductors all over me whether I pass or stop,<br>
            They seize every object and lead it harmlessly through me.<br>
            <br>
            I merely stir, press, feel with my fingers, and am happy,<br>
            To touch my person to some one else’s is about as much as I can stand.<br>
            <br>
            28<br>
            Is this then a touch? quivering me to a new identity,<br>
            Flames and ether making a rush for my veins,<br>
            Treacherous tip of me reaching and crowding to help them,<br>
            My flesh and blood playing out lightning to strike what is hardly different from myself,<br>
            On all sides prurient provokers stiffening my limbs,<br>
            Straining the udder of my heart for its withheld drip,<br>
            Behaving licentious toward me, taking no denial,<br>
            Depriving me of my best as for a purpose,<br>
            Unbuttoning my clothes, holding me by the bare waist,<br>
            Deluding my confusion with the calm of the sunlight and pasture-fields,<br>
            Immodestly sliding the fellow-senses away,<br>
            They bribed to swap off with touch and go and graze at the edges of me,<br>
            No consideration, no regard for my draining strength or my anger,<br>
            Fetching the rest of the herd around to enjoy them a while,<br>
            Then all uniting to stand on a headland and worry me.<br>
            <br>
            The sentries desert every other part of me,<br>
            They have left me helpless to a red marauder,<br>
            They all come to the headland to witness and assist against me.<br>
            <br>
            I am given up by traitors,<br>
            I talk wildly, I have lost my wits, I and nobody else am the greatest traitor,<br>
            I went myself first to the headland, my own hands carried me there.<br>
            <br>
            You villain touch! what are you doing? my breath is tight in its throat,<br>
            Unclench your floodgates, you are too much for me.<br>
            <br>
            29<br>
            Blind loving wrestling touch, sheath’d hooded sharp-tooth’d touch!<br>
            Did it make you ache so, leaving me?<br>
            <br>
            Parting track’d by arriving, perpetual payment of perpetual loan,<br>
            Rich showering rain, and recompense richer afterward.<br>
            <br>
            Sprouts take and accumulate, stand by the curb prolific and vital,<br>
            Landscapes projected masculine, full-sized and golden.<br>
            <br>
            30<br>
            All truths wait in all things,<br>
            They neither hasten their own delivery nor resist it,<br>
            They do not need the obstetric forceps of the surgeon,<br>
            The insignificant is as big to me as any,<br>
            (What is less or more than a touch?)<br>
            <br>
            Logic and sermons never convince,<br>
            The damp of the night drives deeper into my soul.<br>
            <br>
            (Only what proves itself to every man and woman is so,<br>
            Only what nobody denies is so.)<br>
            <br>
            A minute and a drop of me settle my brain,<br>
            I believe the soggy clods shall become lovers and lamps,<br>
            And a compend of compends is the meat of a man or woman,<br>
            And a summit and flower there is the feeling they have for each other,<br>
            And they are to branch boundlessly out of that lesson until it becomes omnific,<br>
            And until one and all shall delight us, and we them.<br>
            <br>
            31<br>
            I believe a leaf of grass is no less than the journey-work of the stars,<br>
            And the pismire is equally perfect, and a grain of sand, and the egg of the wren,<br>
            And the tree-toad is a chef-d’œuvre for the highest,<br>
            And the running blackberry would adorn the parlors of heaven,<br>
            And the narrowest hinge in my hand puts to scorn all machinery,<br>
            And the cow crunching with depress’d head surpasses any statue,<br>
            And a mouse is miracle enough to stagger sextillions of infidels.<br>
            <br>
            I find I incorporate gneiss, coal, long-threaded moss, fruits, grains, esculent roots,<br>
            And am stucco’d with quadrupeds and birds all over,<br>
            And have distanced what is behind me for good reasons,<br>
            But call any thing back again when I desire it.<br>
            <br>
            In vain the speeding or shyness,<br>
            In vain the plutonic rocks send their old heat against my approach,<br>
            In vain the mastodon retreats beneath its own powder’d bones,<br>
            In vain objects stand leagues off and assume manifold shapes,<br>
            In vain the ocean settling in hollows and the great monsters lying low,<br>
            In vain the buzzard houses herself with the sky,<br>
            In vain the snake slides through the creepers and logs,<br>
            In vain the elk takes to the inner passes of the woods,<br>
            In vain the razor-bill’d auk sails far north to Labrador,<br>
            I follow quickly, I ascend to the nest in the fissure of the cliff.<br>
            <br>
            32<br>
            I think I could turn and live with animals, they are so placid and self-contain’d,<br>
            I stand and look at them long and long.<br>
            <br>
            They do not sweat and whine about their condition,<br>
            They do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their sins,<br>
            They do not make me sick discussing their duty to God,<br>
            Not one is dissatisfied, not one is demented with the mania of owning things,<br>
            Not one kneels to another, nor to his kind that lived thousands of years ago,<br>
            Not one is respectable or unhappy over the whole earth.<br>
            <br>
            So they show their relations to me and I accept them,<br>
            They bring me tokens of myself, they evince them plainly in their possession.<br>
            <br>
            I wonder where they get those tokens,<br>
            Did I pass that way huge times ago and negligently drop them?<br>
            <br>
            Myself moving forward then and now and forever,<br>
            Gathering and showing more always and with velocity,<br>
            Infinite and omnigenous, and the like of these among them,<br>
            Not too exclusive toward the reachers of my remembrancers,<br>
            Picking out here one that I love, and now go with him on brotherly terms.<br>
            <br>
            A gigantic beauty of a stallion, fresh and responsive to my caresses,<br>
            Head high in the forehead, wide between the ears,<br>
            Limbs glossy and supple, tail dusting the ground,<br>
            Eyes full of sparkling wickedness, ears finely cut, flexibly moving.<br>
            <br>
            His nostrils dilate as my heels embrace him,<br>
            His well-built limbs tremble with pleasure as we race around and return.<br>
            <br>
            I but use you a minute, then I resign you, stallion,<br>
            Why do I need your paces when I myself out-gallop them?<br>
            Even as I stand or sit passing faster than you.<br>
            <br>
            33<br>
            Space and Time! now I see it is true, what I guess’d at,<br>
            What I guess’d when I loaf’d on the grass,<br>
            What I guess’d while I lay alone in my bed,<br>
            And again as I walk’d the beach under the paling stars of the morning.<br>
            <br>
            My ties and ballasts leave me, my elbows rest in sea-gaps,<br>
            I skirt sierras, my palms cover continents,<br>
            I am afoot with my vision.<br>
            <br>
            By the city’s quadrangular houses—in log huts, camping with lumbermen,<br>
            Along the ruts of the turnpike, along the dry gulch and rivulet bed,<br>
            Weeding my onion-patch or hoeing rows of carrots and parsnips, crossing savannas, trailing in forests,<br>
            Prospecting, gold-digging, girdling the trees of a new purchase,<br>
            Scorch’d ankle-deep by the hot sand, hauling my boat down the shallow river,<br>
            Where the panther walks to and fro on a limb overhead, where the buck turns furiously at the hunter,<br>
            Where the rattlesnake suns his flabby length on a rock, where the otter is feeding on fish,<br>
            Where the alligator in his tough pimples sleeps by the bayou,<br>
            Where the black bear is searching for roots or honey, where the beaver pats the mud with his paddle-shaped
            tail;<br>
            Over the growing sugar, over the yellow-flower’d cotton plant, over the rice in its low moist field,<br>
            Over the sharp-peak’d farm house, with its scallop’d scum and slender shoots from the gutters,<br>
            Over the western persimmon, over the long-leav’d corn, over the delicate blue-flower flax,<br>
            Over the white and brown buckwheat, a hummer and buzzer there with the rest,<br>
            Over the dusky green of the rye as it ripples and shades in the breeze;<br>
            Scaling mountains, pulling myself cautiously up, holding on by low scragged limbs,<br>
            Walking the path worn in the grass and beat through the leaves of the brush,<br>
            Where the quail is whistling betwixt the woods and the wheat-lot,<br>
            Where the bat flies in the Seventh-month eve, where the great gold-bug drops through the dark,<br>
            Where the brook puts out of the roots of the old tree and flows to the meadow,<br>
            Where cattle stand and shake away flies with the tremulous shuddering of their hides,<br>
            Where the cheese-cloth hangs in the kitchen, where andirons straddle the hearth-slab, where cobwebs fall in
            festoons from the rafters;<br>
            Where trip-hammers crash, where the press is whirling its cylinders,<br>
            Wherever the human heart beats with terrible throes under its ribs,<br>
            Where the pear-shaped balloon is floating aloft, (floating in it myself and looking composedly down,)<br>
            Where the life-car is drawn on the slip-noose, where the heat hatches pale-green eggs in the dented
            sand,<br>
            Where the she-whale swims with her calf and never forsakes it,<br>
            Where the steam-ship trails hind-ways its long pennant of smoke,<br>
            Where the fin of the shark cuts like a black chip out of the water,<br>
            Where the half-burn’d brig is riding on unknown currents,<br>
            Where shells grow to her slimy deck, where the dead are corrupting below;<br>
            Where the dense-starr’d flag is borne at the head of the regiments,<br>
            Approaching Manhattan up by the long-stretching island,<br>
            Under Niagara, the cataract falling like a veil over my countenance,<br>
            Upon a door-step, upon the horse-block of hard wood outside,<br>
            Upon the race-course, or enjoying picnics or jigs or a good game of base-ball,<br>
            At he-festivals, with blackguard gibes, ironical license, bull-dances, drinking, laughter,<br>
            At the cider-mill tasting the sweets of the brown mash, sucking the juice through a straw,<br>
            At apple-peelings wanting kisses for all the red fruit I find,<br>
            At musters, beach-parties, friendly bees, huskings, house-raisings;<br>
            Where the mocking-bird sounds his delicious gurgles, cackles, screams, weeps,<br>
            Where the hay-rick stands in the barn-yard, where the dry-stalks are scatter’d, where the brood-cow waits in
            the hovel,<br>
            Where the bull advances to do his masculine work, where the stud to the mare, where the cock is treading the
            hen,<br>
            Where the heifers browse, where geese nip their food with short jerks,<br>
            Where sun-down shadows lengthen over the limitless and lonesome prairie,<br>
            Where herds of buffalo make a crawling spread of the square miles far and near,<br>
            Where the humming-bird shimmers, where the neck of the long-lived swan is curving and winding,<br>
            Where the laughing-gull scoots by the shore, where she laughs her near-human laugh,<br>
            Where bee-hives range on a gray bench in the garden half hid by the high weeds,<br>
            Where band-neck’d partridges roost in a ring on the ground with their heads out,<br>
            Where burial coaches enter the arch’d gates of a cemetery,<br>
            Where winter wolves bark amid wastes of snow and icicled trees,<br>
            Where the yellow-crown’d heron comes to the edge of the marsh at night and feeds upon small crabs,<br>
            Where the splash of swimmers and divers cools the warm noon,<br>
            Where the katy-did works her chromatic reed on the walnut-tree over the well,<br>
            Through patches of citrons and cucumbers with silver-wired leaves,<br>
            Through the salt-lick or orange glade, or under conical firs,<br>
            Through the gymnasium, through the curtain’d saloon, through the office or public hall;<br>
            Pleas’d with the native and pleas’d with the foreign, pleas’d with the new and old,<br>
            Pleas’d with the homely woman as well as the handsome,<br>
            Pleas’d with the quakeress as she puts off her bonnet and talks melodiously,<br>
            Pleas’d with the tune of the choir of the whitewash’d church,<br>
            Pleas’d with the earnest words of the sweating Methodist preacher, impress’d seriously at the
            camp-meeting;<br>
            Looking in at the shop-windows of Broadway the whole forenoon, flatting the flesh of my nose on the thick
            plate glass,<br>
            Wandering the same afternoon with my face turn’d up to the clouds, or down a lane or along the beach,<br>
            My right and left arms round the sides of two friends, and I in the middle;<br>
            Coming home with the silent and dark-cheek’d bush-boy, (behind me he rides at the drape of the day,)<br>
            Far from the settlements studying the print of animals’ feet, or the moccasin print,<br>
            By the cot in the hospital reaching lemonade to a feverish patient,<br>
            Nigh the coffin’d corpse when all is still, examining with a candle;<br>
            Voyaging to every port to dicker and adventure,<br>
            Hurrying with the modern crowd as eager and fickle as any,<br>
            Hot toward one I hate, ready in my madness to knife him,<br>
            Solitary at midnight in my back yard, my thoughts gone from me a long while,<br>
            Walking the old hills of Judæa with the beautiful gentle God by my side,<br>
            Speeding through space, speeding through heaven and the stars,<br>
            Speeding amid the seven satellites and the broad ring, and the diameter of eighty thousand miles,<br>
            Speeding with tail’d meteors, throwing fire-balls like the rest,<br>
            Carrying the crescent child that carries its own full mother in its belly,<br>
            Storming, enjoying, planning, loving, cautioning,<br>
            Backing and filling, appearing and disappearing,<br>
            I tread day and night such roads.<br>
            <br>
            I visit the orchards of spheres and look at the product,<br>
            And look at quintillions ripen’d and look at quintillions green.<br>
            <br>
            I fly those flights of a fluid and swallowing soul,<br>
            My course runs below the soundings of plummets.<br>
            <br>
            I help myself to material and immaterial,<br>
            No guard can shut me off, no law prevent me.<br>
            <br>
            I anchor my ship for a little while only,<br>
            My messengers continually cruise away or bring their returns to me.<br>
            <br>
            I go hunting polar furs and the seal, leaping chasms with a pike-pointed staff, clinging to topples of
            brittle and blue.<br>
            <br>
            I ascend to the foretruck,<br>
            I take my place late at night in the crow’s-nest,<br>
            We sail the arctic sea, it is plenty light enough,<br>
            Through the clear atmosphere I stretch around on the wonderful beauty,<br>
            The enormous masses of ice pass me and I pass them, the scenery is plain in all directions,<br>
            The white-topt mountains show in the distance, I fling out my fancies toward them,<br>
            We are approaching some great battle-field in which we are soon to be engaged,<br>
            We pass the colossal outposts of the encampment, we pass with still feet and caution,<br>
            Or we are entering by the suburbs some vast and ruin’d city,<br>
            The blocks and fallen architecture more than all the living cities of the globe.<br>
            <br>
            I am a free companion, I bivouac by invading watchfires,<br>
            I turn the bridegroom out of bed and stay with the bride myself,<br>
            I tighten her all night to my thighs and lips.<br>
            <br>
            My voice is the wife’s voice, the screech by the rail of the stairs,<br>
            They fetch my man’s body up dripping and drown’d.<br>
            <br>
            I understand the large hearts of heroes,<br>
            The courage of present times and all times,<br>
            How the skipper saw the crowded and rudderless wreck of the steam-ship, and Death chasing it up and down the
            storm,<br>
            How he knuckled tight and gave not back an inch, and was faithful of days and faithful of nights,<br>
            And chalk’d in large letters on a board, Be of good cheer, we will not desert you;<br>
            How he follow’d with them and tack’d with them three days and would not give it up,<br>
            How he saved the drifting company at last,<br>
            How the lank loose-gown’d women look’d when boated from the side of their prepared graves,<br>
            How the silent old-faced infants and the lifted sick, and the sharp-lipp’d unshaved men;<br>
            All this I swallow, it tastes good, I like it well, it becomes mine,<br>
            I am the man, I suffer’d, I was there.<br>
            <br>
            The disdain and calmness of martyrs,<br>
            The mother of old, condemn’d for a witch, burnt with dry wood, her children gazing on,<br>
            The hounded slave that flags in the race, leans by the fence, blowing, cover’d with sweat,<br>
            The twinges that sting like needles his legs and neck, the murderous buckshot and the bullets,<br>
            All these I feel or am.<br>
            <br>
            I am the hounded slave, I wince at the bite of the dogs,<br>
            Hell and despair are upon me, crack and again crack the marksmen,<br>
            I clutch the rails of the fence, my gore dribs, thinn’d with the ooze of my skin,<br>
            I fall on the weeds and stones,<br>
            The riders spur their unwilling horses, haul close,<br>
            Taunt my dizzy ears and beat me violently over the head with whip-stocks.<br>
            <br>
            Agonies are one of my changes of garments,<br>
            I do not ask the wounded person how he feels, I myself become the wounded person,<br>
            My hurts turn livid upon me as I lean on a cane and observe.<br>
            <br>
            I am the mash’d fireman with breast-bone broken,<br>
            Tumbling walls buried me in their debris,<br>
            Heat and smoke I inspired, I heard the yelling shouts of my comrades,<br>
            I heard the distant click of their picks and shovels,<br>
            They have clear’d the beams away, they tenderly lift me forth.<br>
            <br>
            I lie in the night air in my red shirt, the pervading hush is for my sake,<br>
            Painless after all I lie exhausted but not so unhappy,<br>
            White and beautiful are the faces around me, the heads are bared of their fire-caps,<br>
            The kneeling crowd fades with the light of the torches.<br>
            <br>
            Distant and dead resuscitate,<br>
            They show as the dial or move as the hands of me, I am the clock myself.<br>
            <br>
            I am an old artillerist, I tell of my fort’s bombardment,<br>
            I am there again.<br>
            <br>
            Again the long roll of the drummers,<br>
            Again the attacking cannon, mortars,<br>
            Again to my listening ears the cannon responsive.<br>
            <br>
            I take part, I see and hear the whole,<br>
            The cries, curses, roar, the plaudits for well-aim’d shots,<br>
            The ambulanza slowly passing trailing its red drip,<br>
            Workmen searching after damages, making indispensable repairs,<br>
            The fall of grenades through the rent roof, the fan-shaped explosion,<br>
            The whizz of limbs, heads, stone, wood, iron, high in the air.<br>
            <br>
            Again gurgles the mouth of my dying general, he furiously waves with his hand,<br>
            He gasps through the clot Mind not me—mind—the entrenchments.<br>
            <br>
            34<br>
            Now I tell what I knew in Texas in my early youth,<br>
            (I tell not the fall of Alamo,<br>
            Not one escaped to tell the fall of Alamo,<br>
            The hundred and fifty are dumb yet at Alamo,)<br>
            ’Tis the tale of the murder in cold blood of four hundred and twelve young men.<br>
            <br>
            Retreating they had form’d in a hollow square with their baggage for breastworks,<br>
            Nine hundred lives out of the surrounding enemy’s, nine times their number, was the price they took in
            advance,<br>
            Their colonel was wounded and their ammunition gone,<br>
            They treated for an honorable capitulation, receiv’d writing and seal, gave up their arms and march’d back
            prisoners of war.<br>
            <br>
            They were the glory of the race of rangers,<br>
            Matchless with horse, rifle, song, supper, courtship,<br>
            Large, turbulent, generous, handsome, proud, and affectionate,<br>
            Bearded, sunburnt, drest in the free costume of hunters,<br>
            Not a single one over thirty years of age.<br>
            <br>
            The second First-day morning they were brought out in squads and massacred, it was beautiful early
            summer,<br>
            The work commenced about five o’clock and was over by eight.<br>
            <br>
            None obey’d the command to kneel,<br>
            Some made a mad and helpless rush, some stood stark and straight,<br>
            A few fell at once, shot in the temple or heart, the living and dead lay together,<br>
            The maim’d and mangled dug in the dirt, the new-comers saw them there,<br>
            Some half-kill’d attempted to crawl away,<br>
            These were despatch’d with bayonets or batter’d with the blunts of muskets,<br>
            A youth not seventeen years old seiz’d his assassin till two more came to release him,<br>
            The three were all torn and cover’d with the boy’s blood.<br>
            <br>
            At eleven o’clock began the burning of the bodies;<br>
            That is the tale of the murder of the four hundred and twelve young men.<br>
            <br>
            35<br>
            Would you hear of an old-time sea-fight?<br>
            Would you learn who won by the light of the moon and stars?<br>
            List to the yarn, as my grandmother’s father the sailor told it to me.<br>
            <br>
            Our foe was no skulk in his ship I tell you, (said he,)<br>
            His was the surly English pluck, and there is no tougher or truer, and never was, and never will be;<br>
            Along the lower’d eve he came horribly raking us.<br>
            <br>
            We closed with him, the yards entangled, the cannon touch’d,<br>
            My captain lash’d fast with his own hands.<br>
            <br>
            We had receiv’d some eighteen pound shots under the water,<br>
            On our lower-gun-deck two large pieces had burst at the first fire, killing all around and blowing up
            overhead.<br>
            <br>
            Fighting at sun-down, fighting at dark,<br>
            Ten o’clock at night, the full moon well up, our leaks on the gain, and five feet of water reported,<br>
            The master-at-arms loosing the prisoners confined in the after-hold to give them a chance for
            themselves.<br>
            <br>
            The transit to and from the magazine is now stopt by the sentinels,<br>
            They see so many strange faces they do not know whom to trust.<br>
            <br>
            Our frigate takes fire,<br>
            The other asks if we demand quarter?<br>
            If our colors are struck and the fighting done?<br>
            <br>
            Now I laugh content, for I hear the voice of my little captain,<br>
            We have not struck, he composedly cries, we have just begun our part of the fighting.<br>
            <br>
            Only three guns are in use,<br>
            One is directed by the captain himself against the enemy’s mainmast,<br>
            Two well serv’d with grape and canister silence his musketry and clear his decks.<br>
            <br>
            The tops alone second the fire of this little battery, especially the main-top,<br>
            They hold out bravely during the whole of the action.<br>
            <br>
            Not a moment’s cease,<br>
            The leaks gain fast on the pumps, the fire eats toward the powder-magazine.<br>
            <br>
            One of the pumps has been shot away, it is generally thought we are sinking.<br>
            <br>
            Serene stands the little captain,<br>
            He is not hurried, his voice is neither high nor low,<br>
            His eyes give more light to us than our battle-lanterns.<br>
            <br>
            Toward twelve there in the beams of the moon they surrender to us.<br>
            <br>
            36<br>
            Stretch’d and still lies the midnight,<br>
            Two great hulls motionless on the breast of the darkness,<br>
            Our vessel riddled and slowly sinking, preparations to pass to the one we have conquer’d,<br>
            The captain on the quarter-deck coldly giving his orders through a countenance white as a sheet,<br>
            Near by the corpse of the child that serv’d in the cabin,<br>
            The dead face of an old salt with long white hair and carefully curl’d whiskers,<br>
            The flames spite of all that can be done flickering aloft and below,<br>
            The husky voices of the two or three officers yet fit for duty,<br>
            Formless stacks of bodies and bodies by themselves, dabs of flesh upon the masts and spars,<br>
            Cut of cordage, dangle of rigging, slight shock of the soothe of waves,<br>
            Black and impassive guns, litter of powder-parcels, strong scent,<br>
            A few large stars overhead, silent and mournful shining,<br>
            Delicate sniffs of sea-breeze, smells of sedgy grass and fields by the shore, death-messages given in charge
            to survivors,<br>
            The hiss of the surgeon’s knife, the gnawing teeth of his saw,<br>
            Wheeze, cluck, swash of falling blood, short wild scream, and long, dull, tapering groan,<br>
            These so, these irretrievable.<br>
            <br>
            37<br>
            You laggards there on guard! look to your arms!<br>
            In at the conquer’d doors they crowd! I am possess’d!<br>
            Embody all presences outlaw’d or suffering,<br>
            See myself in prison shaped like another man,<br>
            And feel the dull unintermitted pain.<br>
            <br>
            For me the keepers of convicts shoulder their carbines and keep watch,<br>
            It is I let out in the morning and barr’d at night.<br>
            <br>
            Not a mutineer walks handcuff’d to jail but I am handcuff’d to him and walk by his side,<br>
            (I am less the jolly one there, and more the silent one with sweat on my twitching lips.)<br>
            <br>
            Not a youngster is taken for larceny but I go up too, and am tried and sentenced.<br>
            <br>
            Not a cholera patient lies at the last gasp but I also lie at the last gasp,<br>
            My face is ash-color’d, my sinews gnarl, away from me people retreat.<br>
            <br>
            Askers embody themselves in me and I am embodied in them,<br>
            I project my hat, sit shame-faced, and beg.<br>
            <br>
            38<br>
            Enough! enough! enough!<br>
            Somehow I have been stunn’d. Stand back!<br>
            Give me a little time beyond my cuff’d head, slumbers, dreams, gaping,<br>
            I discover myself on the verge of a usual mistake.<br>
            <br>
            That I could forget the mockers and insults!<br>
            That I could forget the trickling tears and the blows of the bludgeons and hammers!<br>
            That I could look with a separate look on my own crucifixion and bloody crowning.<br>
            <br>
            I remember now,<br>
            I resume the overstaid fraction,<br>
            The grave of rock multiplies what has been confided to it, or to any graves,<br>
            Corpses rise, gashes heal, fastenings roll from me.<br>
            <br>
            I troop forth replenish’d with supreme power, one of an average unending procession,<br>
            Inland and sea-coast we go, and pass all boundary lines,<br>
            Our swift ordinances on their way over the whole earth,<br>
            The blossoms we wear in our hats the growth of thousands of years.<br>
            <br>
            Eleves, I salute you! come forward!<br>
            Continue your annotations, continue your questionings.<br>
            <br>
            39<br>
            The friendly and flowing savage, who is he?<br>
            Is he waiting for civilization, or past it and mastering it?<br>
            <br>
            Is he some Southwesterner rais’d out-doors? is he Kanadian?<br>
            Is he from the Mississippi country? Iowa, Oregon, California?<br>
            The mountains? prairie-life, bush-life? or sailor from the sea?<br>
            <br>
            Wherever he goes men and women accept and desire him,<br>
            They desire he should like them, touch them, speak to them, stay with them.<br>
            <br>
            Behavior lawless as snow-flakes, words simple as grass, uncomb’d head, laughter, and naiveté,<br>
            Slow-stepping feet, common features, common modes and emanations,<br>
            They descend in new forms from the tips of his fingers,<br>
            They are wafted with the odor of his body or breath, they fly out of the glance of his eyes.<br>
            <br>
            40<br>
            Flaunt of the sunshine I need not your bask—lie over!<br>
            You light surfaces only, I force surfaces and depths also.<br>
            <br>
            Earth! you seem to look for something at my hands,<br>
            Say, old top-knot, what do you want?<br>
            <br>
            Man or woman, I might tell how I like you, but cannot,<br>
            And might tell what it is in me and what it is in you, but cannot,<br>
            And might tell that pining I have, that pulse of my nights and days.<br>
            <br>
            Behold, I do not give lectures or a little charity,<br>
            When I give I give myself.<br>
            <br>
            You there, impotent, loose in the knees,<br>
            Open your scarf’d chops till I blow grit within you,<br>
            Spread your palms and lift the flaps of your pockets,<br>
            I am not to be denied, I compel, I have stores plenty and to spare,<br>
            And any thing I have I bestow.<br>
            <br>
            I do not ask who you are, that is not important to me,<br>
            You can do nothing and be nothing but what I will infold you.<br>
            <br>
            To cotton-field drudge or cleaner of privies I lean,<br>
            On his right cheek I put the family kiss,<br>
            And in my soul I swear I never will deny him.<br>
            <br>
            On women fit for conception I start bigger and nimbler babes.<br>
            (This day I am jetting the stuff of far more arrogant republics.)<br>
            <br>
            To any one dying, thither I speed and twist the knob of the door.<br>
            Turn the bed-clothes toward the foot of the bed,<br>
            Let the physician and the priest go home.<br>
            <br>
            I seize the descending man and raise him with resistless will,<br>
            O despairer, here is my neck,<br>
            By God, you shall not go down! hang your whole weight upon me.<br>
            <br>
            I dilate you with tremendous breath, I buoy you up,<br>
            Every room of the house do I fill with an arm’d force,<br>
            Lovers of me, bafflers of graves.<br>
            <br>
            Sleep—I and they keep guard all night,<br>
            Not doubt, not decease shall dare to lay finger upon you,<br>
            I have embraced you, and henceforth possess you to myself,<br>
            And when you rise in the morning you will find what I tell you is so.<br>
            <br>
            41<br>
            I am he bringing help for the sick as they pant on their backs,<br>
            And for strong upright men I bring yet more needed help.<br>
            <br>
            I heard what was said of the universe,<br>
            Heard it and heard it of several thousand years;<br>
            It is middling well as far as it goes—but is that all?<br>
            <br>
            Magnifying and applying come I,<br>
            Outbidding at the start the old cautious hucksters,<br>
            Taking myself the exact dimensions of Jehovah,<br>
            Lithographing Kronos, Zeus his son, and Hercules his grandson,<br>
            Buying drafts of Osiris, Isis, Belus, Brahma, Buddha,<br>
            In my portfolio placing Manito loose, Allah on a leaf, the crucifix engraved,<br>
            With Odin and the hideous-faced Mexitli and every idol and image,<br>
            Taking them all for what they are worth and not a cent more,<br>
            Admitting they were alive and did the work of their days,<br>
            (They bore mites as for unfledg’d birds who have now to rise and fly and sing for themselves,)<br>
            Accepting the rough deific sketches to fill out better in myself, bestowing them freely on each man and
            woman I see,<br>
            Discovering as much or more in a framer framing a house,<br>
            Putting higher claims for him there with his roll’d-up sleeves driving the mallet and chisel,<br>
            Not objecting to special revelations, considering a curl of smoke or a hair on the back of my hand just as
            curious as any revelation,<br>
            Lads ahold of fire-engines and hook-and-ladder ropes no less to me than the gods of the antique wars,<br>
            Minding their voices peal through the crash of destruction,<br>
            Their brawny limbs passing safe over charr’d laths, their white foreheads whole and unhurt out of the
            flames;<br>
            By the mechanic’s wife with her babe at her nipple interceding for every person born,<br>
            Three scythes at harvest whizzing in a row from three lusty angels with shirts bagg’d out at their
            waists,<br>
            The snag-tooth’d hostler with red hair redeeming sins past and to come,<br>
            Selling all he possesses, traveling on foot to fee lawyers for his brother and sit by him while he is tried
            for forgery;<br>
            What was strewn in the amplest strewing the square rod about me, and not filling the square rod then,<br>
            The bull and the bug never worshipp’d half enough,<br>
            Dung and dirt more admirable than was dream’d,<br>
            The supernatural of no account, myself waiting my time to be one of the supremes,<br>
            The day getting ready for me when I shall do as much good as the best, and be as prodigious;<br>
            By my life-lumps! becoming already a creator,<br>
            Putting myself here and now to the ambush’d womb of the shadows.<br>
            <br>
            42<br>
            A call in the midst of the crowd,<br>
            My own voice, orotund sweeping and final.<br>
            <br>
            Come my children,<br>
            Come my boys and girls, my women, household and intimates,<br>
            Now the performer launches his nerve, he has pass’d his prelude on the reeds within.<br>
            <br>
            Easily written loose-finger’d chords—I feel the thrum of your climax and close.<br>
            <br>
            My head slues round on my neck,<br>
            Music rolls, but not from the organ,<br>
            Folks are around me, but they are no household of mine.<br>
            <br>
            Ever the hard unsunk ground,<br>
            Ever the eaters and drinkers, ever the upward and downward sun, ever the air and the ceaseless tides,<br>
            Ever myself and my neighbors, refreshing, wicked, real,<br>
            Ever the old inexplicable query, ever that thorn’d thumb, that breath of itches and thirsts,<br>
            Ever the vexer’s hoot! hoot! till we find where the sly one hides and bring him forth,<br>
            Ever love, ever the sobbing liquid of life,<br>
            Ever the bandage under the chin, ever the trestles of death.<br>
            <br>
            Here and there with dimes on the eyes walking,<br>
            To feed the greed of the belly the brains liberally spooning,<br>
            Tickets buying, taking, selling, but in to the feast never once going,<br>
            Many sweating, ploughing, thrashing, and then the chaff for payment receiving,<br>
            A few idly owning, and they the wheat continually claiming.<br>
            <br>
            This is the city and I am one of the citizens,<br>
            Whatever interests the rest interests me, politics, wars, markets, newspapers, schools,<br>
            The mayor and councils, banks, tariffs, steamships, factories, stocks, stores, real estate and personal
            estate.<br>
            <br>
            The little plentiful manikins skipping around in collars and tail’d coats,<br>
            I am aware who they are, (they are positively not worms or fleas,)<br>
            I acknowledge the duplicates of myself, the weakest and shallowest is deathless with me,<br>
            What I do and say the same waits for them,<br>
            Every thought that flounders in me the same flounders in them.<br>
            <br>
            I know perfectly well my own egotism,<br>
            Know my omnivorous lines and must not write any less,<br>
            And would fetch you whoever you are flush with myself.<br>
            <br>
            Not words of routine this song of mine,<br>
            But abruptly to question, to leap beyond yet nearer bring;<br>
            This printed and bound book—but the printer and the printing-office boy?<br>
            The well-taken photographs—but your wife or friend close and solid in your arms?<br>
            The black ship mail’d with iron, her mighty guns in her turrets—but the pluck of the captain and
            engineers?<br>
            In the houses the dishes and fare and furniture—but the host and hostess, and the look out of their
            eyes?<br>
            The sky up there—yet here or next door, or across the way?<br>
            The saints and sages in history—but you yourself?<br>
            Sermons, creeds, theology—but the fathomless human brain,<br>
            And what is reason? and what is love? and what is life?<br>
            <br>
            43<br>
            I do not despise you priests, all time, the world over,<br>
            My faith is the greatest of faiths and the least of faiths,<br>
            Enclosing worship ancient and modern and all between ancient and modern,<br>
            Believing I shall come again upon the earth after five thousand years,<br>
            Waiting responses from oracles, honoring the gods, saluting the sun,<br>
            Making a fetich of the first rock or stump, powowing with sticks in the circle of obis,<br>
            Helping the llama or brahmin as he trims the lamps of the idols,<br>
            Dancing yet through the streets in a phallic procession, rapt and austere in the woods a gymnosophist,<br>
            Drinking mead from the skull-cup, to Shastas and Vedas admirant, minding the Koran,<br>
            Walking the teokallis, spotted with gore from the stone and knife, beating the serpent-skin drum,<br>
            Accepting the Gospels, accepting him that was crucified, knowing assuredly that he is divine,<br>
            To the mass kneeling or the puritan’s prayer rising, or sitting patiently in a pew,<br>
            Ranting and frothing in my insane crisis, or waiting dead-like till my spirit arouses me,<br>
            Looking forth on pavement and land, or outside of pavement and land,<br>
            Belonging to the winders of the circuit of circuits.<br>
            <br>
            One of that centripetal and centrifugal gang I turn and talk like a man leaving charges before a
            journey.<br>
            <br>
            Down-hearted doubters dull and excluded,<br>
            Frivolous, sullen, moping, angry, affected, dishearten’d, atheistical,<br>
            I know every one of you, I know the sea of torment, doubt, despair and unbelief.<br>
            <br>
            How the flukes splash!<br>
            How they contort rapid as lightning, with spasms and spouts of blood!<br>
            <br>
            Be at peace bloody flukes of doubters and sullen mopers,<br>
            I take my place among you as much as among any,<br>
            The past is the push of you, me, all, precisely the same,<br>
            And what is yet untried and afterward is for you, me, all, precisely the same.<br>
            <br>
            I do not know what is untried and afterward,<br>
            But I know it will in its turn prove sufficient, and cannot fail.<br>
            <br>
            Each who passes is consider’d, each who stops is consider’d, not a single one can it fail.<br>
            <br>
            It cannot fail the young man who died and was buried,<br>
            Nor the young woman who died and was put by his side,<br>
            Nor the little child that peep’d in at the door, and then drew back and was never seen again,<br>
            Nor the old man who has lived without purpose, and feels it with bitterness worse than gall,<br>
            Nor him in the poor house tubercled by rum and the bad disorder,<br>
            Nor the numberless slaughter’d and wreck’d, nor the brutish koboo call’d the ordure of humanity,<br>
            Nor the sacs merely floating with open mouths for food to slip in,<br>
            Nor any thing in the earth, or down in the oldest graves of the earth,<br>
            Nor any thing in the myriads of spheres, nor the myriads of myriads that inhabit them,<br>
            Nor the present, nor the least wisp that is known.<br>
            <br>
            44<br>
            It is time to explain myself—let us stand up.<br>
            <br>
            What is known I strip away,<br>
            I launch all men and women forward with me into the Unknown.<br>
            <br>
            The clock indicates the moment—but what does eternity indicate?<br>
            <br>
            We have thus far exhausted trillions of winters and summers,<br>
            There are trillions ahead, and trillions ahead of them.<br>
            <br>
            Births have brought us richness and variety,<br>
            And other births will bring us richness and variety.<br>
            <br>
            I do not call one greater and one smaller,<br>
            That which fills its period and place is equal to any.<br>
            <br>
            Were mankind murderous or jealous upon you, my brother, my sister?<br>
            I am sorry for you, they are not murderous or jealous upon me,<br>
            All has been gentle with me, I keep no account with lamentation,<br>
            (What have I to do with lamentation?)<br>
            <br>
            I am an acme of things accomplish’d, and I an encloser of things to be.<br>
            <br>
            My feet strike an apex of the apices of the stairs,<br>
            On every step bunches of ages, and larger bunches between the steps,<br>
            All below duly travel’d, and still I mount and mount.<br>
            <br>
            Rise after rise bow the phantoms behind me,<br>
            Afar down I see the huge first Nothing, I know I was even there,<br>
            I waited unseen and always, and slept through the lethargic mist,<br>
            And took my time, and took no hurt from the fetid carbon.<br>
            <br>
            Long I was hugg’d close—long and long.<br>
            <br>
            Immense have been the preparations for me,<br>
            Faithful and friendly the arms that have help’d me.<br>
            <br>
            Cycles ferried my cradle, rowing and rowing like cheerful boatmen,<br>
            For room to me stars kept aside in their own rings,<br>
            They sent influences to look after what was to hold me.<br>
            <br>
            Before I was born out of my mother generations guided me,<br>
            My embryo has never been torpid, nothing could overlay it.<br>
            <br>
            For it the nebula cohered to an orb,<br>
            The long slow strata piled to rest it on,<br>
            Vast vegetables gave it sustenance,<br>
            Monstrous sauroids transported it in their mouths and deposited it with care.<br>
            <br>
            All forces have been steadily employ’d to complete and delight me,<br>
            Now on this spot I stand with my robust soul.<br>
            <br>
            45<br>
            O span of youth! ever-push’d elasticity!<br>
            O manhood, balanced, florid and full.<br>
            <br>
            My lovers suffocate me,<br>
            Crowding my lips, thick in the pores of my skin,<br>
            Jostling me through streets and public halls, coming naked to me at night,<br>
            Crying by day Ahoy! from the rocks of the river, swinging and chirping over my head,<br>
            Calling my name from flower-beds, vines, tangled underbrush,<br>
            Lighting on every moment of my life,<br>
            Bussing my body with soft balsamic busses,<br>
            Noiselessly passing handfuls out of their hearts and giving them to be mine.<br>
            <br>
            Old age superbly rising! O welcome, ineffable grace of dying days!<br>
            <br>
            Every condition promulges not only itself, it promulges what grows after and out of itself,<br>
            And the dark hush promulges as much as any.<br>
            <br>
            I open my scuttle at night and see the far-sprinkled systems,<br>
            And all I see multiplied as high as I can cipher edge but the rim of the farther systems.<br>
            <br>
            Wider and wider they spread, expanding, always expanding,<br>
            Outward and outward and forever outward.<br>
            <br>
            My sun has his sun and round him obediently wheels,<br>
            He joins with his partners a group of superior circuit,<br>
            And greater sets follow, making specks of the greatest inside them.<br>
            <br>
            There is no stoppage and never can be stoppage,<br>
            If I, you, and the worlds, and all beneath or upon their surfaces, were this moment reduced back to a pallid
            float, it would not avail in the long run,<br>
            We should surely bring up again where we now stand,<br>
            And surely go as much farther, and then farther and farther.<br>
            <br>
            A few quadrillions of eras, a few octillions of cubic leagues, do not hazard the span or make it
            impatient,<br>
            They are but parts, any thing is but a part.<br>
            <br>
            See ever so far, there is limitless space outside of that,<br>
            Count ever so much, there is limitless time around that.<br>
            <br>
            My rendezvous is appointed, it is certain,<br>
            The Lord will be there and wait till I come on perfect terms,<br>
            The great Camerado, the lover true for whom I pine will be there.<br>
            <br>
            46<br>
            I know I have the best of time and space, and was never measured and never will be measured.<br>
            <br>
            I tramp a perpetual journey, (come listen all!)<br>
            My signs are a rain-proof coat, good shoes, and a staff cut from the woods,<br>
            No friend of mine takes his ease in my chair,<br>
            I have no chair, no church, no philosophy,<br>
            I lead no man to a dinner-table, library, exchange,<br>
            But each man and each woman of you I lead upon a knoll,<br>
            My left hand hooking you round the waist,<br>
            My right hand pointing to landscapes of continents and the public road.<br>
            <br>
            Not I, not any one else can travel that road for you,<br>
            You must travel it for yourself.<br>
            <br>
            It is not far, it is within reach,<br>
            Perhaps you have been on it since you were born and did not know,<br>
            Perhaps it is everywhere on water and on land.<br>
            <br>
            Shoulder your duds dear son, and I will mine, and let us hasten forth,<br>
            Wonderful cities and free nations we shall fetch as we go.<br>
            <br>
            If you tire, give me both burdens, and rest the chuff of your hand on my hip,<br>
            And in due time you shall repay the same service to me,<br>
            For after we start we never lie by again.<br>
            <br>
            This day before dawn I ascended a hill and look’d at the crowded heaven,<br>
            And I said to my spirit When we become the enfolders of those orbs, and the pleasure and knowledge of every
            thing in them, shall we be fill’d and satisfied then?<br>
            And my spirit said No, we but level that lift to pass and continue beyond.<br>
            <br>
            You are also asking me questions and I hear you,<br>
            I answer that I cannot answer, you must find out for yourself.<br>
            <br>
            Sit a while dear son,<br>
            Here are biscuits to eat and here is milk to drink,<br>
            But as soon as you sleep and renew yourself in sweet clothes, I kiss you with a good-by kiss and open the
            gate for your egress hence.<br>
            <br>
            Long enough have you dream’d contemptible dreams,<br>
            Now I wash the gum from your eyes,<br>
            You must habit yourself to the dazzle of the light and of every moment of your life.<br>
            <br>
            Long have you timidly waded holding a plank by the shore,<br>
            Now I will you to be a bold swimmer,<br>
            To jump off in the midst of the sea, rise again, nod to me, shout, and laughingly dash with your hair.<br>
            <br>
            47<br>
            I am the teacher of athletes,<br>
            He that by me spreads a wider breast than my own proves the width of my own,<br>
            He most honors my style who learns under it to destroy the teacher.<br>
            <br>
            The boy I love, the same becomes a man not through derived power, but in his own right,<br>
            Wicked rather than virtuous out of conformity or fear,<br>
            Fond of his sweetheart, relishing well his steak,<br>
            Unrequited love or a slight cutting him worse than sharp steel cuts,<br>
            First-rate to ride, to fight, to hit the bull’s eye, to sail a skiff, to sing a song or play on the
            banjo,<br>
            Preferring scars and the beard and faces pitted with small-pox over all latherers,<br>
            And those well-tann’d to those that keep out of the sun.<br>
            <br>
            I teach straying from me, yet who can stray from me?<br>
            I follow you whoever you are from the present hour,<br>
            My words itch at your ears till you understand them.<br>
            <br>
            I do not say these things for a dollar or to fill up the time while I wait for a boat,<br>
            (It is you talking just as much as myself, I act as the tongue of you,<br>
            Tied in your mouth, in mine it begins to be loosen’d.)<br>
            <br>
            I swear I will never again mention love or death inside a house,<br>
            And I swear I will never translate myself at all, only to him or her who privately stays with me in the open
            air.<br>
            <br>
            If you would understand me go to the heights or water-shore,<br>
            The nearest gnat is an explanation, and a drop or motion of waves a key,<br>
            The maul, the oar, the hand-saw, second my words.<br>
            <br>
            No shutter’d room or school can commune with me,<br>
            But roughs and little children better than they.<br>
            <br>
            The young mechanic is closest to me, he knows me well,<br>
            The woodman that takes his axe and jug with him shall take me with him all day,<br>
            The farm-boy ploughing in the field feels good at the sound of my voice,<br>
            In vessels that sail my words sail, I go with fishermen and seamen and love them.<br>
            <br>
            The soldier camp’d or upon the march is mine,<br>
            On the night ere the pending battle many seek me, and I do not fail them,<br>
            On that solemn night (it may be their last) those that know me seek me.<br>
            <br>
            My face rubs to the hunter’s face when he lies down alone in his blanket,<br>
            The driver thinking of me does not mind the jolt of his wagon,<br>
            The young mother and old mother comprehend me,<br>
            The girl and the wife rest the needle a moment and forget where they are,<br>
            They and all would resume what I have told them.<br>
            <br>
            48<br>
            I have said that the soul is not more than the body,<br>
            And I have said that the body is not more than the soul,<br>
            And nothing, not God, is greater to one than one’s self is,<br>
            And whoever walks a furlong without sympathy walks to his own funeral drest in his shroud,<br>
            And I or you pocketless of a dime may purchase the pick of the earth,<br>
            And to glance with an eye or show a bean in its pod confounds the learning of all times,<br>
            And there is no trade or employment but the young man following it may become a hero,<br>
            And there is no object so soft but it makes a hub for the wheel’d universe,<br>
            And I say to any man or woman, Let your soul stand cool and composed before a million universes.<br>
            <br>
            And I say to mankind, Be not curious about God,<br>
            For I who am curious about each am not curious about God,<br>
            (No array of terms can say how much I am at peace about God and about death.)<br>
            <br>
            I hear and behold God in every object, yet understand God not in the least,<br>
            Nor do I understand who there can be more wonderful than myself.<br>
            <br>
            Why should I wish to see God better than this day?<br>
            I see something of God each hour of the twenty-four, and each moment then,<br>
            In the faces of men and women I see God, and in my own face in the glass,<br>
            I find letters from God dropt in the street, and every one is sign’d by God’s name,<br>
            And I leave them where they are, for I know that wheresoe’er I go,<br>
            Others will punctually come for ever and ever.<br>
            <br>
            49<br>
            And as to you Death, and you bitter hug of mortality, it is idle to try to alarm me.<br>
            <br>
            To his work without flinching the accoucheur comes,<br>
            I see the elder-hand pressing receiving supporting,<br>
            I recline by the sills of the exquisite flexible doors,<br>
            And mark the outlet, and mark the relief and escape.<br>
            <br>
            And as to you Corpse I think you are good manure, but that does not offend me,<br>
            I smell the white roses sweet-scented and growing,<br>
            I reach to the leafy lips, I reach to the polish’d breasts of melons.<br>
            <br>
            And as to you Life I reckon you are the leavings of many deaths,<br>
            (No doubt I have died myself ten thousand times before.)<br>
            <br>
            I hear you whispering there O stars of heaven,<br>
            O suns—O grass of graves—O perpetual transfers and promotions,<br>
            If you do not say any thing how can I say any thing?<br>
            <br>
            Of the turbid pool that lies in the autumn forest,<br>
            Of the moon that descends the steeps of the soughing twilight,<br>
            Toss, sparkles of day and dusk—toss on the black stems that decay in the muck,<br>
            Toss to the moaning gibberish of the dry limbs.<br>
            <br>
            I ascend from the moon, I ascend from the night,<br>
            I perceive that the ghastly glimmer is noonday sunbeams reflected,<br>
            And debouch to the steady and central from the offspring great or small.<br>
            <br>
            50<br>
            There is that in me—I do not know what it is—but I know it is in me.<br>
            <br>
            Wrench’d and sweaty—calm and cool then my body becomes,<br>
            I sleep—I sleep long.<br>
            <br>
            I do not know it—it is without name—it is a word unsaid,<br>
            It is not in any dictionary, utterance, symbol.<br>
            <br>
            Something it swings on more than the earth I swing on,<br>
            To it the creation is the friend whose embracing awakes me.<br>
            <br>
            Perhaps I might tell more. Outlines! I plead for my brothers and sisters.<br>
            <br>
            Do you see O my brothers and sisters?<br>
            It is not chaos or death—it is form, union, plan—it is eternal life—it is Happiness.<br>
            <br>
            51<br>
            The past and present wilt—I have fill’d them, emptied them,<br>
            And proceed to fill my next fold of the future.<br>
            <br>
            Listener up there! what have you to confide to me?<br>
            Look in my face while I snuff the sidle of evening,<br>
            (Talk honestly, no one else hears you, and I stay only a minute longer.)<br>
            <br>
            Do I contradict myself?<br>
            Very well then I contradict myself,<br>
            (I am large, I contain multitudes.)<br>
            <br>
            I concentrate toward them that are nigh, I wait on the door-slab.<br>
            <br>
            Who has done his day’s work? who will soonest be through with his supper?<br>
            Who wishes to walk with me?<br>
            <br>
            Will you speak before I am gone? will you prove already too late?<br>
            <br>
            52<br>
            The spotted hawk swoops by and accuses me, he complains of my gab and my loitering.<br>
            <br>
            I too am not a bit tamed, I too am untranslatable,<br>
            I sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.<br>
            <br>
            The last scud of day holds back for me,<br>
            It flings my likeness after the rest and true as any on the shadow’d wilds,<br>
            It coaxes me to the vapor and the dusk.<br>
            <br>
            I depart as air, I shake my white locks at the runaway sun,<br>
            I effuse my flesh in eddies, and drift it in lacy jags.<br>
            <br>
            I bequeath myself to the dirt to grow from the grass I love,<br>
            If you want me again look for me under your boot-soles.<br>
            <br>
            You will hardly know who I am or what I mean,<br>
            But I shall be good health to you nevertheless,<br>
            And filter and fibre your blood.<br>
            <br>
            Failing to fetch me at first keep encouraged,<br>
            Missing me one place search another,<br>
            I stop somewhere waiting for you.<br>
