            Go placidly amid the noise and haste,<br>
            and remember what peace there may be in silence.<br>
            As far as possible without surrender<br>
            be on good terms with all persons.<br>
            Speak your truth quietly and clearly;<br>
            and listen to others,<br>
            even the dull and the ignorant;<br>
            they too have their story.<br>
            <br>
            Avoid loud and aggressive persons,<br>
            they are vexations to the spirit.<br>
            If you compare yourself with others,<br>
            you may become vain and bitter;<br>
            for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.<br>
            Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans.<br>
            <br>
            Keep interested in your own career, however humble;<br>
            it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.<br>
            Exercise caution in your business affairs;<br>
            for the world is full of trickery.<br>
            But let this not blind you to what virtue there is;<br>
            many persons strive for high ideals;<br>
            and everywhere life is full of heroism.<br>
            <br>
            Be yourself.<br>
            Especially, do not feign affection.<br>
            Neither be cynical about love;<br>
            for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment<br>
            it is as perennial as the grass.<br>
            <br>
            Take kindly the counsel of the years,<br>
            gracefully surrendering the things of youth.<br>
            Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune.<br>
            But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings.<br>
            Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness.<br>
            Beyond a wholesome discipline,<br>
            be gentle with yourself.<br>
            <br>
            You are a child of the universe,<br>
            no less than the trees and the stars;<br>
            you have a right to be here.<br>
            And whether or not it is clear to you,<br>
            no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.<br>
            <br>
            Therefore be at peace with God,<br>
            whatever you conceive Him to be,<br>
            and whatever your labors and aspirations,<br>
            in the noisy confusion of life keep peace with your soul.<br>
            <br>
            With all its sham, drudgery, and broken dreams,<br>
            it is still a beautiful world.<br>
            Be cheerful.<br>
            Strive to be happy.<br>
